        "    Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n",
        "    Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n",

        "    Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.\n",
        "    Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\n",
        "    Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.\n"
